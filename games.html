        <h1>Me as a gamer</h1>
        <p>
          I have been an enthusiastic gamer since kindergarten(yes kindergarten, when I used to<br>
          play games made by flash). I play a wide variety of games, but RPG games and strategy<br>
          games have always been my favorite. Here I am going to introduce several of my<br>
          favorite video games. Just for fun.

          I have many games in my Steam Library, but I have only finished a few of them. The<br>
          Witcher 3 is a game that I did not only one, but more than 5 playthroughs. The story<br>
          is so intriguing that I could not stop thinking about it even during classes (umm that<br>
          is probably not good...).

        <h2>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</h2>

        <p>
          This is by far the best open world RPG game in the world (in my opinion). Unlike the<br>
          Witcher 3, where the RPG part plays a more important role, Skyrim emphasizes on the<br>
          the open world element of the game, meaning instead of experiencing a story written<br>
          by someone else, you get to write your own story. You can be a hero, a thief, an<br>
          assassin, or just a normal people. Everything is totally up to you. It also has an<br>
          active mod community, which keeps adding new contents to the game.

        <h2>Europa Universalis IV</h2>

          This game allows you to play as one of the nations existed in the world from 1444 to<br>
          1821. It is a little bit complicated to get started with this game because there are<br>
          so many systems and mechanics. However, once you are familiar with it, there will be<br>
          an infinite number of possibilities to explore. You can play as Spain to discover and<br>
          colonize the new world, play as the newly founded United States to fight for<br>
          independence, or even create your own country and try to conquer the world. Of course,<br>
          my favorite thing to do is always to REBUILD THE ROMAN EMPIRE! S!P!Q!R!
