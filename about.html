        <p>
          Hi there! My name is Chuan Shi, and I am a freshman at the University of Washington.<br>
          I came from Suzhou, China, and went to Los Angeles in 2016 for high school. I am eager<br>
          to learn everything about Computer Science to expand my knowledge base. CSE 154 is my<br>
          first class on web programming, and I am really excited to build my own website!<br>
